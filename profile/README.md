## Hi there 👋
Welcome to our GitHub page! At fiskaltrust, we aim to create a standard for carefree fiscalization all over Europe. 

We do so by developing an open-source POS Middleware with an international interface that can be embedded in all POS systems, either cloud-based or on-premise.
Together with our add-on products - e.g. for revision-safe storage and 3rd party integrations - the Middleware is a perfect match for POS system manufacturers, software developers and system integrators who want to leave baseline POS features like fiscalization, payment or digital receipts to us, and focus on their core businesses.

> 🍿 The Middleware has recently been Open-Sourced! Please check out the [repository](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/middleware) for further details.
