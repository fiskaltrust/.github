# Support
If you are one of fiskaltrust's partners and need support for non-code-related problems, please **don't create GitHub issues**, but reach out to our support team via phone or e-mail. Common types of support cases may be:
- Problems with setting up or rolling out Middleware instances
- Issues while obtaining products from fiskaltrust
- End-user issues at runtime, e.g. decreased signing times, crashes, etc.

Phone numbers, addresses and response times are subject to the respective country of operation, and are described in our _Service Level Agreements_ that can be obtained via the _Download_ area in the fiskaltrust Portal.

> Please note that support SLAs are only applicable to the channels agreed in the contracts, and that fiskaltrust cannot guarantee fixed response times for issues created on GitHub.
